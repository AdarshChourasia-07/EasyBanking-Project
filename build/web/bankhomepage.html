          Home computers are typically not very secure and are easy to break-in. When combined with high-speed Internet connections that are always turned on, intruders can quickly find and then attack home computers. There may not be important data stored on the home computers but they are targeted by the intruders for launching attack against other computers. So it is prudent to follow some guidelines to protect home computers against any such mis-use. Following are some tips for securing home computers:

         Protecting against Phishing Attacks
When user receives an e-mail asking him to visit his bank's web site, it signifies the beginning of a phishing fraud. The e-mail would usually provide a link to bank's web site and ask the user to click the link. It would ask him to provide certain confidential banking information like his account number, credit card number etc., failing which his account would be doomed. There would be a sense of urgency and panic in the e-mail. This type of attack is called as phising attack.
Here is a checklist, which helps to prevent this type of attack:
        </p>
        <p>
          Check to see if the e-mail is indeed from your Bank and not from just any bank. If it isn't, don't click on any link/ image/ icon in the mail. Almost all banks, never ask their customers to provide their username, password, or credit card numbers.
Never click any link given inside the e-mail message. Directly type the URL of your Bank in address field of browser. If you do not know the URL of your bank's website, take time to call immediately to your Bank to find out.
Check the language and spelling of the text contained in the e-mail. If you find misspelled words or substandard language, conclude that it is not from your bank.
If the e-mail urges to act immediately without delay, failing which your account will be closed down, stop reading it. It is not from your bank.
Never provide your personal information to anybody, come what may.
